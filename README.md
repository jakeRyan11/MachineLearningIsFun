Project :🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and location. The model uses Linear Regression to analyze historical data and provide accurate price estimations, assisting real estate professionals, investors, and homeowners in making informed decisions.

🔍 Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values and outliers
Applied categorical encoding for non-numeric features
Scaled numerical features for better model performance
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions and correlations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
Identified key factors influencing house prices
Machine Learning Model

Implemented Linear Regression using Scikit-learn
Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation
Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics

Used R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Optimized model hyperparameters for better accuracy
